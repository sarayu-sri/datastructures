                    <strong>Linked List</strong> is a list of elements(containing data) in which the elements are linked together. Each data is connected (or linked) to a different data and thus, forming a linear list of data, and this is a linked list. Since data in a linked list are stored in a linear fashion, a linked list is a linear data structure. We know that we have to connect data of a linked list and to do so, we put our data in nodes and these nodes are connected in the desired fashion.

                    A node can be viewed as a container or a box which contains data and other information in it. Nodes are connected (or organized) in a specific way to make data structures like linked lists.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each node has two parts, one stores the data and another is connected to a different node. The last node is not connected to any other node and thus, its connection to the next node is null.</li>
                        <li>In a linked list, a node is connected to a different node forming a chain of nodes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Thus to make a linked list, we first need to make a node which should store some data into it and also a link to another node.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                    <li>A node should store some data and a connection to a different node. For this, structure is used to store this information, and to store the connection, we can simply store the address of the node which it will be linked to.</li>

                    Here's a C program to make two nodes and connect one with another.
                    <code>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
        #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
        
        struct node {
            int data;
            struct node *next;
        };
        
        int main() {
            struct node *a, *b;
            a = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
            b = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
        
            a->data = 10;
            b->data = 20;
        
            a->next = b;
            b->next = NULL;
        
            printf("%d\n%d\n",a->data, a->next->data);
            return 0;

                    A node in a linked list is deleted by connecting the predecessor node of the node to be deleted by the successor of the node.

                    <p>The push operation adds a new element to the stack. As stated above, any element added to the stack goes at the top, so push adds an element at the top of a stack.</p>
                    <h2>Pop():</h2>
                    <p>The pop operation removes and also returns the top-most (or most recent element) from the stack.</p>
                    <h2>Top():</h2>

For example, a new person enters a queue at the last and the person who is at the front (who must have entered the queue at first) will be served first.</p>
